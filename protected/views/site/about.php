                What inspires a young English man to launch an innovative, authentic Asian fast food concept in the UK? 
            </p>
            <p>
                A love of the taste and aromas of the East and time spent in the Asian dining districts of the Big Apple.<br/> “I got home from a trip to New York in 2007 reeling with a sense of opportunity and excitement about the myriad of quick, casual, convenient dining experiences on offer. I wanted to recreate authentic, Asian cuisine in a casual and relaxed atmosphere. For me, the answer was Wok&Go,<br/> a tasty, healthy, fresh and nutritious Asian food cooked to order in minutes before the customers’ eyes, that they could eat on the hop at simple tables and benches or take away in a box.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                Wok&Go first opened its doors in Chester in 2008 and has grown into a unique brand led fusion food chain blending the best of Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian, Chinese and Japanese cuisine. Now with franchises across the North West, North East, Southern England and the Middle East, with Mainland Europe and the USA coming soon...<br/><br/>Wok&Go has become the UK's number one Noodle Bar Chain.
