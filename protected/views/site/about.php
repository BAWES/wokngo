        The concept of Wok&Go was formed in 2007 by founder Des Pheby's travels to New York and through his love for the 
        aromas and tastes of the east. "I wanted to recreate the taste of Asia in a casual and relaxed atmosphere". 
        Wok&Go provides people with tasty and healthy eating at a reasonable price. Our busy lifestyles don't always 
        afford us the time to wait in a traditional restaurant. Wok&Go gives us the delicious taste of Asia cooked to 
        order in only a few minutes. You can then choose to eat at the benches and tables inside or take it home in the box.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our menu is fusion of the various tastes of Asia. It includes Thai Malaysian 
        Indonesian Chinese and Japanese in the form of wok tossed noodles, Stir fries, curries, soups, vegetarian, rice meals 
        and our even healthier skinny noodles. The healthy and fresh ingredients used in most Asian cuisine means that Wok&Go 
        is a great choice for the health conscious. 
        Most of our menu items are a minimum of 95% fat free, and many of these contain less than 3g of fat per hundred g.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wok&Go is spreading its tastes of Asia across the UK with stores in Chester, Liverpool, Nottingham, 
        Leeds, Birmingham and Hull and internationally in Kuwait.
