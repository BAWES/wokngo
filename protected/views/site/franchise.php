            <p>
                Our franchisees tend to have some traits in common: 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Self-motivated:</span> <br/>
                You need to be driven, ambitious, disciplined and determined to succeed
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Organized:</span> <br/>
                You need to be good at juggling (not knives) but many different and interdependent tasks
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Motivational:</span> <br/>
                Getting the best from your team is critical to your franchise’s reputation and financial success
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Customer service focused:</span> <br/>
                Dealing with the public takes enthusiasm, tenacity and a happy smile!
            </p>
            <p>
                You don’t need previous retail or catering experience, but some management experience is an advantage in running your own demanding and exciting retail business.
