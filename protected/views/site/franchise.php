    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1bb2f2;">Organized:</span> 
    You need to be good at juggling (not knives) but many different and interdependent tasks
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1bb2f2;">Motivational:</span>
    Getting the best from your team is critical to your franchise’s reputation and financial success
